## About This Project

This project is a collection of lab code, course assignments, and some course resources completed during my undergraduate studies in **Computer Science and Technology** at the **School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**.

The main purpose of creating this project is for personal archival and to provide a reference for fellow students or anyone interested in the related courses. Please note that the code and solutions in this repository represent my understanding at the time and may not always be the most optimal or complete solutions.

Feel free to browse, learn, and use these resources responsibly.
